It\u2019s a framework where knowledge isn\u2019t fixed but evolves continuously through open collaboration, community review, and shared discovery.</p> <p>Inspired by both academic publishing and the open-source movement, CLM treats every page, lesson, and idea as part of a living system that grows with its contributors \u2014 not a static textbook, but a versioned knowledge ecosystem.</p> <p>In practice:</p> <ul> <li>Content is versioned and openly editable.  </li> <li>Every contribution is transparent, credited, and traceable.  </li> <li>Learners are encouraged to participate as co-authors, not just readers.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#11-why-clm-exists","title":"1.1 Why CLM Exists","text":"<p>GitHub lets us collaborate on code. CLM extends that spirit to knowledge itself.</p> <p>Most learning platforms stop at consumption \u2014 read, watch, complete. CLM continues into co-creation: you learn by contributing to the very material you study.</p> <p>It\u2019s not about replacing universities or GitHub \u2014 it\u2019s about creating a space where education feels open-source, peer-driven, and alive.</p>"},{"location":"#2-who-is-it-for","title":"2.
