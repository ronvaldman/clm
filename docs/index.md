## 1. What is CLM?

CLM — the **Continuous Learning Model** — is a new way to think about learning. It’s a framework where knowledge isn’t fixed but evolves continuously through open collaboration, community review, and shared discovery.

Inspired by both academic publishing and the open-source movement, CLM treats every page, lesson, and idea as part of a living system that grows with its contributors — **not a static textbook, but a versioned knowledge ecosystem.**

In practice:

- Content is versioned and openly editable.  
- Every contribution is transparent, credited, and traceable.  
- Learners are encouraged to participate as co-authors, not just readers.

## 1.1 Why CLM Exists

GitHub lets us collaborate on *code.*  
CLM extends that spirit to *knowledge itself.*

Most learning platforms stop at consumption — read, watch, complete.  
CLM continues into **co-creation**: you learn *by contributing* to the very material you study.

It’s not about replacing universities or GitHub — it’s about creating a space where education feels **open-source, peer-driven, and alive.**

## 2. Who Is It For?

CLM is designed for anyone who wants to learn, teach, or build openly — without institutional walls.

- Students who want structured, peer-reviewed study materials.  
- Educators who wish to publish open textbooks that improve through versioned community input.  
- Developers and researchers who enjoy treating knowledge like open-source code — branch, improve, merge.

## 3. How It Works

1. Fork or clone the repo.  
2. Add or improve anything.  
3. Submit a pull request for peer review.  
4. Approved changes merge into the main CLM edition.

Each page evolves over time — **continuously.**

## 4. Contributing and Licensing

CLM is released under a **Creative Commons BY-SA** license.  
Contributors retain credit while allowing anyone to build upon their work — with attribution.

See [How to Contribute](meta/contributing.md) for full guidelines.

## 5. Roadmap

CLM is built openly, with each phase shaped by community feedback and contribution.

Upcoming milestones:

- Public launch of the CLM platform at **learn-clm.com**  
- Core Computer Science curriculum covering foundations, programming, systems, and theory  
- Peer-review workflow to enable collaborative editing and knowledge validation  
- Contributor tools for authors and educators to publish their own modules  
- Expansion beyond CS into new disciplines under the Continuous Learning Model
