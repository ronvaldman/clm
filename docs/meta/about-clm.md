# About CLM

The **Continuous Learning Model (CLM)** treats a textbook like open-source software:

- Chapters are Markdown files in a Git repo.
- Changes happen through branches and pull requests.
- Content is peer-reviewed before merging.
- The website is rebuilt and republished continuously.

**Computer Science CLM** is the first implementation of this idea.
